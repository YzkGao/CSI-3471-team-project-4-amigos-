1. This runable jar must be in the same path with the resource folder.

2. The resource folder contains the database and some pictures that the jar will use.

3. The program will automatically generate a database if there is no database in the resource folder.

4. We prepared a database for grading, testing, and presentation. The database has some records in October 2021 and November 2021.

5. If you want a empty database, just delete the database.
